# This Repo contains the javascript written by TrimarkUSA's Product Team for the TriMarketPlace Site

## Why this repository exists
In our Rhythm platform set up, each page within Rhythm has an input field under the advanced tab where we can add custom javascript to the site to modify the look or feel of the page. We also have an input available to add custom javascript to the entire site in Rhythm.
The all-pages.js file in this repository is the site wide js, all other files are javascript we add to specific pages in Rhythm and the code within those files is specific to that page.

We are creating CDNs for each javascript file in this repository via [JSDelivr]: https://www.jsdelivr.com/github
